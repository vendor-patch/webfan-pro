# ![Webfan](https://webfan.de/favicon.ico) The `PRO` Attribute - Webfantized for You and We.

In Webfan-Contexts the `PRO`-project attributes specific software, services, work or any other items assigned to the `PRO`-Stack.
A `PRO`-attributed work must not fullify all `PRO`-properties but at least one of them and finally it has to be added by [me](https://till.wehowski.webfan.me) manually.

## Criterias
A *PRO-attributed by Webfan* item MUST be either...
* *pro*duct or *pro*ject
* run in or build for *pro*duction deployments
* *pro*fessional solution used, embedded, sold, provieded, managed, advertised or just loved by Webfan

*  ~~<s>stitution</s>~~ <--- really WTF dont use it, not my business!
