# `The **PRO** Attribute` - Webfantized for You and We.
In Webfan-Contexts the `PRO`-project attributes specific software, services, work or any other items assigned to the `PRO`-Stack.
A `PRO`-attributed work must not fullify all `PRO`-properties but at least one of them and finally it has to be added by [me](https://till.wehowski.webfan.me) manually.
