# `CON`TRADICTION - Please speach it out!
*Like with every `PRO` there will be one who will find the `CON`TRA.* 
So if you will find anything here attributed as `PRO` and you think it should NOT be in my repository, due to whatever, I bag you to contribute and report the infringement!

Sometimes, although one software or paradigma may have worked well for long time, there could happen a EndOfLife, deprecations, end of support, or just 
better or updated solutions.

* **PragmaMx**
  The PragmaNx CMS was used by and integrated into the Webfan Site many years ago, I developed and contributed
  some modules and modifications and recommended the usage of the CMS.
  PragmaMx is still running on Webhosting Customers Pages, but I stopped to use PragmaMx on my websites,
  do not develop anything related to the CMS and I do not recommend to use it anymore but suggest to migrate.
  I just do not find it useful to integrate it in modern projects anymore, although it does a good job for me once!
